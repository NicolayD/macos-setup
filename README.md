# macos-setup

The aim of this repository is to have a set of scripts to setup a macOS machine according to my personal preferences.

This includes:
  - setting specific macOS system settings
  - installing Homebrew
  - installing various libraries through Homebrew, e.g. PostgreSQL, version managers
  - installing Docker
  - installing iTerm with oh-my-zsh
  - installing the Zed editor
  - installing TablePlus
  - (possibly) setting up Git

And anything else I might think of along the way.

## Gotchas

Terminal (or the terminal application used) might require Disk Access enabled.
